### Short description of gameplay:

    - There is a character you control using the arrow keys, and you interact with other characters and elements in the game using the mouse. You are on a mission to make the legendary soup. Collect all the ingredients for a chance to make the soup and become a souper chef!  

### List of games that are similar or serve as inspiration:

    - Candy Crush  
    - Doki Doki Literature Club  
    - Stardew Valley  

### Win condition:

    - Collect the ingredients and make the soup to become a souper chef  

### Lose condition:

    - Fail to collect all the ingredients or make the soup incorrectly  

### How the player interacts with the game:

    - Player will use the arrow keys to move the character around the screen and the mouse to interact with various characters and elements  

### The game engine and other tools you plan to use to create the game:

    - HaxeFlixel  
    - Artist Friends  

### List of core features:

##### These are things you must have for the game to be complete in a basic way.  

#####    You should have a clear idea of you think you should be able to implement these, or have a plan for figuring them out / asking for help about them early in the project.  

        - Player Character  
        - Ingredients for soup  
        - Puzzles/activities for gathering each ingredient  
        - Puzzle/activity for making soup  
        - Win Screen  
        - List of ingredients on screen, so that the player can see what they have collected  

### List of secondary features:

##### These are things that are still important, but not as critical enough to be 'core'.  

##### It's best if you have a rough idea of how these would work as well, but you can get away with them being a bit less well-defined - if they fall through, you still have your core game intact.  

        - NPCs to serve as instructors for collecting each ingredient  
        - Rival Chef NPC for storyline  
        - Pop up Dialog when interacting with NPCs  

### List of bonus features:

##### These are things that would be nice to have, but are definitely non-essential. After 'core' and 'secondary' features are complete, these take priority.  

        - added storyline  
        - added complexity to making soup stage  

### Realistic goals/expectations for the ~4 weeks of work on the project:

    - basic functionality (player exists and can move, and click works) May 2  
    - ingredients and puzzles/activities implimented (where it works, not pretty...) May 9  
    - storyline and graphics implemented (in basic way) May 11  
    - Make it all pretty May 16
